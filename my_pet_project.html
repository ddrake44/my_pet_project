    <h1>This is my first independent project about my pet.</h1>
    <h2>I haveonly ever had one pet.</h2>
    <h3>... It was a turtle.</h3>

    <p>
    I once had a turtle, infact it was two. One died a tragic death, but I will get to that later. The two turtles were a gift from two kind neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
    The turtles were a unique gift because they were pet. At a young age, due to a number of contributing factors I was unable to have a cat or dog because I was allergic.
